import java.util.Scanner;

public class UniversityDiscountByInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // creating scanner object and taking input
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int fee = input.nextInt();

        // university discount
        int discountPercent = input.nextInt();

        // discount offer calculation
        double discount = fee / (double)discountPercent;

        // after applying discount the fee that needs to be paid
        int feePay = fee - (int)discount;

        // output
        System.out.println("The discount amount is INR "+ discount +" and final discounted fee is INR " + feePay);

        input.close();
