// An athlete runs in a triangular park with sides provided as input by the user in meters. If the athlete wants to complete a 5 km run, then how many rounds must the athlete complete
// Hint => The perimeter of a triangle is the addition of all sides and rounds is distance/perimeter
// I/P => side1, side2, side3
// O/P => The total number of rounds the athlete will run is ___ to complete 5 km
